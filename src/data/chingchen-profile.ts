                  During my internship, I discovered my passion in software development, 
                  had adrenaline rush from the first day till the last day of my internship! Just please don't remind me how terrible my spaghetti code was.`

          During my Bachelor Degree studies, I was awarded to the merit scholarship.

        `Being a non-IT engineering graduate, 
          it may be or may be not difficult for us to secure a job in software development field depending on the university programme structure 
          (and/or self-studies during leisure time). Most of the non-IT engineering programme only introduce basic programming courses. 
          Fortunately, free/paid online learning materials are all over the internet. 
          One of the main challenges is, we don't know what we don't know at most of the times. 
          Gotta start to understand the industry by reading the job description in the job ads to find out the popular skillsets and industry requirement, 
          it is probably a good place to start and a great indicator too! As a starter, learn the programming language, 
          understand the general programming fundamental knowledge such as SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, OOP, version control etc.  
          Most importantly, be curious! :D

          To make it worse, I enrolled the part-time programme to see how far can I stretch myself.          
          At the end of 2020, with tons of sweat and enough swear words (to myself), I obtained my Master's Degree.`

          I still find myself continuously gaining new knowledge and new challenges from my career.
          Today, I still constantly asking "how" and "why" in my job, fun!
